# Data platforms on Chameleon

This lab builds a small data platform for a hypothetical GourmetGram service:

* use PostgreSQL for application data
* Support real time event services with RedPanda
* materialize Iceberg tables with Airflow
* train a moderation model from Iceberg snapshots

To run this experiment, we should already have a Chameleon account, be added to a project, and have our SSH key registered for KVM@TACC.
